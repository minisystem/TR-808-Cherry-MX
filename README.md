ROLAND TR-808 START/STOP + TAP TEMPO REPLACEMENT SWITCHES
============

Use these files to fabricate the parts needed to replace the TR-808 Start/Stop and Tap switches with modern Cherry MX
switches. The clear plastic shell with the paper label snaps onto the 3D printed caps and the fit should be tight enough
to be held on by friction alone.

/Gerbers contains the Gerber files to fabricate the PCB adapter. .stp and/or .stl are for 3D printing the caps that will
fit the Cherry MX plunger.
